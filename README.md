I developed a Connect 4 game using C++, bringing the classic board game to life in a digital format. This project demonstrates my skills in programming logic, user interface design, and array manipulation. Players can engage in strategic matchups, dropping their colored discs into the grid to connect four in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game's intuitive design and functionality showcase my ability to create an enjoyable and interactive gaming experience using C++.
